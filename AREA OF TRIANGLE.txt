SOURCE CODE:-

a = int(input(" Enter the value of a "))
b = int(input(" Enter the value of b "))
c =int(input(" Enter the value of c "))


s = (a + b + c) / 2


area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)

OUTPUT:-

Enter the value of a 25
 Enter the value of b 35
 
 Enter the value of c 21
